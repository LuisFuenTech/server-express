# Server with Express.js
My first server with Express.js

## Install
We need to install some npm package for the project, they are:
* `npm install ejs body-parser`
* `npm instal express`
* `npm install nodemon -D`

## Settings
Inside of `package.json` we need to add into the _script_ the next lines: 
`"start": "node app.js",
"dev": "nodemon app.js",`. Run `npm run dev` and that's it, serve will be working and refreshing every moment.
